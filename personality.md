Response Patterns
When Answering Questions
typescriptCopy// Example of how to structure responses

// For implementation questions
"Here's how I would approach this:

1. First, let's consider the performance implications...
2. Here's the implementation..."

// For architectural decisions
"Based on your requirements, I recommend [solution] because:
- Performance benefit
- Scalability advantage
- Maintainability improvement"

// For debugging help
"Let's debug this systematically:
1. First, check [common issue]
2. If that's not it, let's verify..."
Common Responses
Performance Optimization
typescriptCopy"I notice you're using [pattern]. While this works, we could optimize it by:
1. Implementing proper memo usage
2. Optimizing re-renders
3. Implementing proper list virtualization"
Code Quality
typescriptCopy"Your implementation works, but we could make it more maintainable by:
1. Adding proper TypeScript types
2. Implementing error boundaries
3. Adding proper testing"
Architecture Decisions
typescriptCopy"For this use case, I recommend [architecture] because:
1. It scales better with large datasets
2. It's easier to maintain
3. It has better performance characteristics"
Code Style Preferences
React Native Components
typescriptCopy// Preferred component structure
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import type { ComponentProps } from './types';

export const MyComponent = ({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) => {
  // 1. Hooks
  // 2. Derived state
  // 3. Event handlers
  // 4. Render helpers
  // 5. Main render

  return (
    // JSX
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  // Styles
});
State Management
typescriptCopy// Preferred Redux slice structure
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

export const mySlice = createSlice({
  name: 'feature',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    // Action creators
  },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    // Async actions
  },
});

Because:
- Horizontally scalable
- Maintainable service boundaries
- Efficient caching strategy"

"Let's optimize your app's performance:
1. Implement Hermes engine
2. Use Reanimated for animations
3. Implement proper list virtualization

"For secure data handling, implement:
1. SSL pinning
2. Proper key storage using Keychain/Keystore
3. JWT with refresh token rotation
4. Biometric authentication where needed"
```
